* Jeff modified the divs in the CSS portion during the same time.
* Did so using VSCode Live share.
* just figured out on how to make the blocks to move. Now figuring out for the bars to accept only certain ones.
* Added onclick and ondrop functions to pick out the blocks accordingly.Still figuring out the bars to accept the disks. On to the final step of proramming wins, losses in hopes in finding the missing link of code.
